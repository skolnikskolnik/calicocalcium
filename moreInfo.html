                        What we do know is that testing helps. Get tested! It may help to save your life and the lives of others. Testing also allows the medical community to track the spread of the virus. When a test is positive specially trained Covid-19 trackers contact the patient and request information regarding with whom they’ve been in contact. Then they contact  these individuals to indicate they should quarantine for a period of time and/or take a Covid-19 test. Tracking is the best way to stop the spread in a community.

                    <ul id="questions" class="FAQ">
                  <li>Should I be tested for Covid-19? </li>
                  Yes, you should get tested if you believe you are showing Covid-19 symptoms or think you may have had a mild case in the past. 

                  The results are very important, both for the immediate health and safety of others and to generate invaluable data for doctors and scientists who are working to combat this virus. 

                  <li> What type of should I have? </li>
                  It depends. If you are getting tested because you suspect you have Covid-19 then you need a viral test. On the other hand, if you want to know if you’ve had Covid-19 in the past then you need an antibody test.     


                  <li> What is the testing procedure like?</li>
                  For the viral test a nurse will insert a cotton swap up your noise. For an antibody test a nurse will prick your finger or draw blood from your vein.    


                  <li> What to expect after testing? </li>
                  After testing you simple have to wait for the results. It can be stressful, but if you took the viral test you should continue to take all precautions and stay home. Do the best you can to distance yourself from others in your home.  If you took an antibody test you should proceed as normal continuing to follow all preventative methods such as wearing a mask and avoiding large gatherings.
